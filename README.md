## ⚙️ Process

### 1. Data Shaping (ETL)
- Extracted raw datasets from multiple sources.  
- Transformed data for consistency (cleaning nulls, formatting columns, handling duplicates).  
- Loaded structured data into Power BI for modeling.  

### 2. Data Modeling
- Established **1-to-many relationships** between primary and foreign keys.  
- Designed **Star Schema** for simplified reporting.  
- Applied **Snowflake Schema** for normalized data connections.  

### 3. DAX Calculations
- Created measures for **Revenue per Customer, Return Rate, Monthly Revenue Trends, Profitability**.  
- Defined KPIs aligned with business goals.  
- Applied filters and slicers for dynamic analysis.  

### 4. Dashboard Development
- Built interactive dashboards with:  
  - Line charts for **monthly revenue and customer acquisition trends**.  
  - Pie charts for **orders by category and income level**.  
  - Bar charts for **orders by product type**.  
  - Tables for **top customers and product profitability**.  
- Enabled drill-through and filtering for deeper insights.

## 📊 Key Insights
From the dashboard analysis:  
- **Revenue Growth**: Monthly revenue showed a steady upward trend with forecasted growth.  
- **Top Categories**: Accessories and Electronics contributed the highest share of orders.  
- **Customer Segmentation**: High-income customers generated ~45% of total orders, highlighting a premium market.  
- **Return Behavior**: Return rate was low (~2.2%), with specific products driving higher returns.  
- **Product Profitability**: Mountain bike models and related accessories were consistently profitable.
